# Minimal-JVM

A fun project to not only further my understanding of Java, but also teach myself a new paradigm (functional) and langauge (Haskell). The virtual machine will be minimal, in that it should be able to handle basic class loading, execute bytecode, and maintain a basic runtime environment (stack + heap + method area).

## Progress

The below list is very premature, and will undoubtedly grow to become more verbose in the future.

- [x] Basic `.class` file parser
- [ ] Implement and execute ByteCode instructions
- [ ] Implement a basic heap with minimal garbage collection
